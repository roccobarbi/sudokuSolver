# sudokuSolver
A Java application that solves sudoku puzzles.

Please note that this application is unfinished and does not work, as I was following a wrong (human-like, not computational) approach. For a complete version that works, please refer to my more recent project https://github.com/roccobarbi/SudokuSolver2.
